"# BDN9-macropad" 

I am working on this macro pad to solve a lot of minor inconveniences in my day to day experience.
Because it is only 9 keys, I made it so that there can be an infinite amount of options with the use 
of layers. It is indeed tricky to remember which key is on what layer since there are such limitless 
options, and because of this I have it so that when the layer is changed, the background has its own 
designated color. It is also coded so that the bottom right key is discord mute/unmute, and the RGB 
is green when the mic is open, and red when it is muted.

To set the Discord mute, go to the discord app after flashing, and set the keybind to do "Toggle Mute", 
then tap the key once.

To toggle the rotary encoder to deafen on press, do the same as line 10, but "Toggle Deafen."
